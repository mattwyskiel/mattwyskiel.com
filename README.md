# Personal Website - mattwyskiel.com

I've decided to rebuild my website from the ground up. Again.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped manually, using Bun. It uses Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Development Commands

- `bun run dev` - Start development server
- `bun run build` - Build for production
- `bun run start` - Start production server
- `bun run lint` - Run ESLint
- `bun run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking (use `tsc --noEmit`)
