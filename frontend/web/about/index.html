    <p>
      I'm a computer nerd who specializes in mobile and web full-stack application development. I've
      created two iOS apps, and done even more with backend programming and cloud architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Sacred Heart University, currently
      employed as a software developer.

    <p>
      When Iâ€™m not making apps work, you can find me listening to an eclectic mix of music or
      discussing current events at length.
