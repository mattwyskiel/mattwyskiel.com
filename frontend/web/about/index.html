        <p>I'm a computer nerd who specializes in mobile and web full-stack application development. I've created two iOS apps, and done even more with backend programming and cloud architecture.</p>
        <p>I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Sacred Heart University, currently employed as a software developer.</p>

        <p>When Iâ€™m not making apps work, you can find me listening to an eclectic mix of music or discussing current events at length.</p>
