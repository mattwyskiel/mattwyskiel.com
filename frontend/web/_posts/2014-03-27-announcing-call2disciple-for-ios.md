To start off this blog strong, I thought I'd showcase my new app, available now in the App Store!

#### What is Call2Disciple?

[Call2Disciple](http://www.call2disciple.com/) is a religious organization that sells resources on CD, DVD, and in hardcover/paperback books that fulfill their mission statement: to "proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ."

#### Why did I make this app?

This is my first app, so I needed an idea. This ministry sprouts off from my family, and I help out with the social/video part of it. Call2Disciple makes great use of social media to spread their message and basically lives online, so this app was a necessary effort to expand its reach.

#### Short Tour - what does it do?

When the user opens the app for the first time, he or she will come to the list of posts from Call2Disciple's popular blog. Click on a post and the user can read each post, images and all:

The user can click on the next tab and access the videos (via the YouTube API)

Clicking on a video in this list brings you to a YouTube video from the Call2Disciple channel.

The user can also access contact information and receive push notifications on any updates.

This is a simple app, but it has great potential ahead. Download it now on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/call2disciple/id833015192?mt=8&amp;uo=4).
